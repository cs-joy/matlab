% Basic image import, processing and export

% step 1: read and display image
I = imread('profile.jpg');

% Display the image, using the `imshow` function. You can also view an image 
% in the Image Viewer app. The `imtool` function opens the Image Viewer app 
% which presents an integrated environment for displaying images and performing
% some common image processing tasks. The Image Viewer app provides all the image
% display capabilities of imshow but also provides access to several other tools 
% for navigating and exploring images, such as scroll bars, the Pixel Region tool,
% Image Information tool, and the Contrast Adjustment tool.

imshow(I)

% Step 2: Check How the Image Appears in the Workspace
%
% Check how the imread function stores the image data in the workspace, 
% using the whos command. You can also check the variable in the Workspace Browser.
% The imread function returns the image data in the variable I , 
% which is a 291-by-240 element array of uint8 data.

whos I

% Step 3: Improve Image Contrast
%
% View the distribution of image pixel intensities. The image pout.tif is a
% somewhat low contrast image. To see the distribution of intensities in the image, 
% create a histogram by calling the imhist function. (Precede the call to imhist with
% the figure command so that the histogram does not overwrite the display of the image 
% I in the current figure window.) Notice how the histogram indicates that the intensity
% range of the image is rather narrow. The range does not cover the potential range of [0, 255],
% and is missing the high and low values that would result in good contrast.

imhist(I)


% Improve the contrast in an image, using the histeq function. Histogram 
% equalization spreads the intensity values over the full range of the image. 
% Display the image. (The toolbox includes several other functions that perform 
% contrast adjustment, including imadjust and adapthisteq, and interactive tools 
% such as the Adjust Contrast tool, available in the Image Viewer.)

I2 = histeq(I);

imshow(I)

% check the workspace
whos I2

% Call the imhist function again to create a histogram of the equalized image I2 .
% If you compare the two histograms, you can see that the histogram of I2 is more
% spread out over the entire range than the histogram of I .
figure
imhist(I2)


% Step 4: Write the Adjusted Image to a Disk File
%
% Write the newly adjusted image I2 to a disk file, using the imwrite function.
% This example includes the filename extension '.png' in the file name, 
% so the imwrite function writes the image to a file in Portable Network Graphics (PNG) format,
% but you can specify other formats.
imwrite(I2, 'profile2.png');

% Step 5: Check the Contents of the Newly Written File
%
% View what imwrite wrote to the disk file, using the imfinfo function. 
% The imfinfo function returns information about the image in the file, 
% such as its format, size, width, and height.
imfinfo('profile2.png')
